	; Music_RestH_LUT is indexed by (Music_RestH_Base + Music_RestH_Off + [0 to 15])
	; * Music_RestH_Base is always divisible by $10, Music_RestH_Off is $00 or $10
	;
	; * Offset (0 to 15) comes from the lower 4 bits of $80+ values
	;   (The upper 4 bits set a patch value, unrelated)
	;
	; * Result is a "rest" (in ticks) for the pause between events
	;
	; * Obviously that means a song is "optimized" by selecting the best set, and
	;   must have a correct row +$10 if it plans on being "low time warning compatible"
